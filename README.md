Gem [RTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_tactics) game engine

## Why?

Gem is a 3D game engine built to make real time tactics games, or [RTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_tactics) for short.
In particular, Gem is built for making games focused on providing [Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War_(video_game_series)) like battle scenarios.
Gem provides a set of homogeneous and well integrated tools that allow game developers to flawlessly develop games targeting the [RTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_tactics) genre.

## How?

Gem is written in C++. We do not reinvent the wheel. We use battle tested libraries to bring the most feature rich and solid software we can.

## Platforms

Gem aims to support Windows.
There are plans for supporting both MacOS and Linux.
